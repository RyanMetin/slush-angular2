## Development

To start your app run:

```bash
gulp src
```

## Production

Bundle your work:

```bash
gulp build:all
```

Then start app with:

```bash
gulp dist
```

## TypeScript

Not working properly at the moment.
However, typescript can be compiled from src/ts/ with:

```bash
gulp build:ts
```
